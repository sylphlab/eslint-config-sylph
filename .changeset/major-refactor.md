feat: Refactor package structure, migrate docs, and adopt Turborepo

Major restructuring of the monorepo:
- Renamed packages to full names (e.g., `base` -> `eslint-config-sylph`).
- Migrated TypeScript guidelines from the main Playbook repo into the `docs/` directory here.
- Introduced Turborepo for monorepo management.
- Updated all package READMEs with detailed philosophy and usage.
- Updated root README to reflect new structure and purpose.
